Steps to reproduce:
Patient setup: in a school session today, marked as attending, session has HPV and doubles, patients is eligible for all vaccines (has consent, correct year group, no history)
Complete pre-screening questions and vaccinate the patient for any one vaccine (eg. HPV)
Testing has confirmed the following:
Two vaccinations in same session
- If HPV is followed by MenACWY then ""feeling well"" is pre-filled
- If HPV is followed by Td/IPV  then both ""feeling well"" and ""not pregnant"" are pre-populated
- If MenACWY followed by Td/IPV then ""feeling well"" is pre-filled
- If MenCAWY followed by HPV then ""feeling well"" is pre-filled
- If Td/IPV followed by MenACWY  then ""feeling well"" is pre-filled
- If Td/IPV is followed by HPV  then both ""feeling well"" and ""not pregnant"" are pre-populated
